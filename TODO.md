## Things to do


### Core issues
-> Make the tests work better.
-> Refactor all the code surrounding the cruft
-> Make mosaic into a library that can be used in the web app (ie webapp is now a different library)

### Webapp issues

-> Have save to Twitter/Instagram/Dropbox (?) option.
-> Post login and display, the flow should work without server process restart.
-> Figure out a good way to store the files (securely etc)
-> Provide login and logout options.


---------
- A "library" that has all the "core stuff"
- A Web app part with the MVC
