## Things to do

-> Re-calcuate the image height
-> Resize it to contain a maximum of 1600 images. (ie 400 * 400) -> Max resolution is 640 x 640 (if we don't re-use, if we use, make it 1024 x 1024)
-> Should we use the same image more than once ? Not sure, but let us do it in the beginning.
-> Create image tiles
-> ** Module ** Find the image(s) with the nearest color in the given range for an image.
-> Redraw the rect using the tile (and loop over all rects)
-> Write the image back to the disk.
-> Crop (ie tile creation- rect is okay i guesss, no crop required)
