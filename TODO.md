## Things to do


### Core issues
-> Refactor the mosaic.go file.
-> Test out once the above is done.
-> Create a new launcher (`main.go`) for the standalone app and separate out the web app launcher.
-> Test again.
-> Add README and all then submit.

### Nice to have stuff

-> Have save to Twitter/Instagram/Dropbox (?) option.
-> Post login and display, the flow should work without server process restart.
-> Figure out a good way to store the files (securely etc)
-> Provide login and logout options.
