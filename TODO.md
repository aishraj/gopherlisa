## Things to do


### Core issues
-> Re-order the modules. (image, commons, web)
-> Make mosaic into a library that can be used in the web app (ie webapp is now a different library)
-> Remove dependency on the hard coded paths
-> Refactor all the code surrounding the cruft
-> Make the tests work better.

### Webapp issues

-> Display the changed image on a web page
-> Have save to Twitter/Instagram/Dropbox (?) option.
-> Post login and display, the flow should work without server process restart.
-> Figure out a good way to store the files (securely etc)
-> Provide login and logout options.
